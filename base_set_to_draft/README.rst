===================
Base Set To Draft
===================

Many document model that already has been cancelled may also want change back to draft.
It is painful if we have to code one by one the functionality button.

This module does not provide a functionality by itself but an abstract model.

**Note:** To be able to use this module in a new model you will need some
development.

You can see implementation example as followings,

* `picking_set_to_draft <https://github.com/amirul-m/public-odoo-apps/tree/14.0/base_set_to_draft>`_
